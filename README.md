This repository has an GUI program in python where a text file data is encrypted to cipher text and the cipher text is then decrypted to plain text

The application uses tkinter package so that the Graphical User Interface is created using Python

Once the program is executed, the GUI pops up and you can load a text file which needs to be encypted. The encryted file is stored as .enc file. 
To open the ,enc file you can use Sublime text. This .enc file has the encrypted data of the text file that was selected.
